'The termination of the first volume of the Zoological Illustrations is accomplished, and its contents will not only enable our readers to discern the nature of the work, but likewise to form a judgement, on that degree of improvement which we have introduced since its first publication, and they may safely rely on the continuation being in no respect inferior.
In commencing a work of this nature, we have had two principal objects in view: the diffusion of original observations, which, while they might further the ends of science, would also be interesting to the general reader; and that of discouraging the publication of distorted figures copied from old authors, by accustoming the public eye to original designs and correct representations of natural objects. How far we may have succeeded in this latter object, remains to be judged by others; we are however satisfied with having made the attempt, and we hope that abler pencils than our own, may engage in the prosecution of this most desirable object; for it is only by the publication of original matter, that a check can be given to the increasing number of compilations and multiplied copies of ""ill-shaped"" figures, by which error is perpetuated, and science retarded.
The only original work that has appeared in this country similar to our own, is the Zoological Miscellany by Dr. Leach, which, as it was discontinued after the third volume, it may be presumed was unsuccessful: although little can be said of many of the figures in the early volumes, those in the latter are much to be praised, and the whole are original; the descriptions also abound with details highly interesting to the scientific world, for which indeed the learned author principally intended it; nevertheless it is a question, whether science in the end would not have been equally, and perhaps more advanced, had this work been more adapted to general readers. Instruction in these days of refinement must be made easy, palatable, and enticing; the eye must be pleased, while the understanding is improved, and Wisdom in her simple dignified garb will often be deserted for Ignorance, decked out in the glittering trappings of Folly.'",,"Science and Technology, Biology, Zoology",Open (Access) Textbook,https://www.merlot.org/merlot/materials.htm?materialType=13,"March 16, 2015","March 28, 2015",William Swainson,Cathy Swift,https://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewMember.htm?id=11397,"College Lower Division,

The flying squirrels of the tribe Pteromyini within the rodent family Sciuridae represent the greatest diversity of gliding mammals, with a total of 48 species in 15 genera currently recognized, and occur throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. A second group of gliding rodents, known as the scaly-tailed flying squirrels, comprises six species from the family Anomaluridae that live in central and western Africa. The most specialized and unique of the extant gliding mammals are the enigmatic colugos, or flying lemurs, of the order Dermoptera that comprise two species and occur throughout Southeast Asia and the Philippines. In addition to the extant species there are various fossils of extinct species that are thought to have had an ability to glide, although there has been a lot of debate over most of these taxa.

It explains how they work physiologically and describes their appearance, behavior, and perception of the world. It progresses from a sponge, as simple as an animal can be, to the highly developed octopus and ant.'
'It is easy for humans to relate to dogs or other mammals, difficult to see any kinship with flower-like anemones, supple octopuses, or many-legged spiders. Yet we are all animals that have to deal with the basic problems of living. Bodies need to be supported and muscles to pull against firm structures. Instead of skeletons, invertebrates use structures such as exoskeletons and cavities filled with fluid. All animals must catch their food, even if they are fixed in one place, digest their food, and get rid of wastes. All must reproduce their kind by finding mates and giving their offspring the necessary start in life. When crayfish moved from the sea to fresh water, they evolved special excretory organs to retain essential salts in their bodies, developed the ability to lie dormant during periods of drought or climatic extremes, and nurtured their young until they were mature enough to deal with 0the stress of living in fresh water. When spiders and insects moved onto the land, their permeable respiratory surfaces had to be enclosed within their bodies, and they evolved internal book lungs and tracheal systems that exchanged oxygen for carbon dioxide through small holes in their exoskeletons. Meet the Invertebrates introduces readers to representatives of the major invertebrate groups, with their wide range of life styles and the adaptations they have evolved to fit them -- the bath sponge, the giant green anemone, the beef tapeworm, the roundworm Ascaris, the common earthworm, the common sea star, the hard shell clam, the giant Pacific octopus, the red swamp crayfish, the garden spider, the German cockroach, the spicebush swallowtail butterfly, and the little black ant. Meet the Invertebrates explains how these animals “work” physiologically and, in the case of higher invertebrates, psychologically. It describes the animals from a subjective as well as an objective point of view – how they look and behave, live their everyday lives, and perceive the world. An octopus sees the world with eyes much like our own; a spider senses it through legs that detect the minutest vibrations on her web; an ant uses her antennas to smell and feel her nestmates, other animals, and her environment. The book progresses from a sponge, as simple as an animal can be, to the highly developed octopus and ant. When a sponge is subjected to a poke or a chemical stimulus, the particular cells affected react individually. Cnidarians such as anemones evolved nerve cells specialized to receive information and convey it relatively fast, but these are simply connected on a loose network. Flatworms evolved a tiny brain to direct their activities. Octopuses have a large brain with over 30 specialized lobes. They show curiosi-ty and can solve complicated problems; one taught herself to open a child-proof pill bottle in 5 minutes.The scientific classification given at the end of each chapter shows how the subject fits into the animal kingdom. This is followed by a sampling of human reactions to these animals, from Victor Hugo’s horror of the octopus to Maurice Maeterlinck’s glowing praise of the ant’s courage, generosity and altruism.'",,"Science and Technology, Biology, Zoology",Open (Access) Textbook,https://www.merlot.org/merlot/materials.htm?materialType=13,"March 16, 2015","March 28, 2015",Katharine Rogers,Cathy Swift,https://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewMember.htm?id=11397,"College Lower Division,
